/**
 * An equivalent of [com.badlogic.gdx.Game] delegating game events to a [Screen]. On contrary to `Game`, [KtxGame]
 * maintains a collection of screens mapped by their type and allows to change screens knowing only their type with
 * [setScreen]. Thanks to this, its easier to cache screens without maintaining a singleton with all [Screen] instances
 * manually. [ScreenType] generic type allows to users to use an extended specific base class (or interface) for all
 * screens, without locking into [Screen].
 *
 * Since this is a [KotlinApplication] extension, it also handles screen clearing and fixed rendering time step. See
 * [KotlinApplication] for more info.
 *
 * @param firstScreen will be immediately used by the application. Note that it cannot use any resources initiated by
 * the LibGDX (like the OpenGL context) in the constructor, as the screen will be created before the application is
 * launched. Defaults to an empty, mock-up screen implementation that should be replaced with the first [setScreen]
 * method call in [create]. Note: `firstScreen` still has to be explicitly registered with [addScreen] if you want it to
 * be accessible with [getScreen].
 * @param fixedTimeStep see [KotlinApplication.fixedTimeStep].
 * @param maxDeltaTime see [KotlinApplication.maxDeltaTime].
 * @param ScreenType common base interface or class of all screens. Allows to use custom extended [Screen] API.
 * @see KtxScreen
